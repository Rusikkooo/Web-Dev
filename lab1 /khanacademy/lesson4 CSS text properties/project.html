        <h2 id="first post">First post-How I got into KBTU</h2>

        <p id="about_first_post">
            I am so happy to share my story about entering KBTU (Kazakh-British Technical University)! It was a long journey, but it was worth it.In school, I chose Informatics and Mathematics. I love technology and solving problems, so these subjects were perfect for me.I studied very hard for the National Unified Test. In the end, I got 115 points! I was very excited because this score gave me a chance to study at one of the best universities in Kazakhstan.KBTU was my first choice. It is a great place for future IT specialists and engineers.Now I am a student here, and I am ready for new challenges!

        <h2 id = "second post">Second post-A Day in the Life of a KBTU Student</h2>

        <p id="about_sp">Have you ever wondered what a typical day looks like for an IT student at KBTU? Let me show you! <br> My day begins early in the morning. I wake up, wash up, and have a quick breakfast. A good cup of coffee is a "must-have" to start my brain and get ready for the day! <br>

            Then, I head to our beautiful and historic KBTU building. I really love the atmosphere here; it feels like <strong>"Hogwarts for tech people."</strong>  My favorite part of the day is the <strong>Web Development</strong>  class. We are learning how to build cool websites using <strong>  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>. It is challenging, but very exciting to see my code come to life! <br>  
            
            During lunch break, I hang out with my friends in the canteen. We usually eat together and talk about our projects, new startups, or upcoming deadlines. After classes, I don't go home immediately. I spend a couple of hours in the university library to finish my homework and practice coding because it needs a lot of focus. <br>
            
            In the evening, it’s time to chill. I usually walk around   <strong>Panfilov Street</strong> or go home to relax. It’s the perfect way to end the day after "debugging" my life and my code. Being a KBTU student is hard work, but <em>I love every minute of it!</em> </p>
